# 100 Days of React

This repository is a part of my #100DaysOfReact challenge, where I'll be learning React and building projects to enhance my skills. Each day, I'll be working on a new project, documenting my progress, and sharing the code in this repository.

## Goals

- Learn React and its core concepts
- Build a portfolio of React projects
- Improve my understanding of front-end development
- Gain hands-on experience with popular React libraries and frameworks

## Progress Tracking

I will be using the [#100DaysOfReact](https://twitter.com/pr0devs/status/1675097576247361536?s=20) hashtag on Twitter and [#100DaysOfReact](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/adedamola-olawale-b9b1641a2_100daysofreact-reactjs-learninginpublic-activity-7080868168650362881-N1BR?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) hashtag on LinkedIn to share my daily progress and insights.
