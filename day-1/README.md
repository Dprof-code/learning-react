### Day 1: [React Component]

- Description:  I created a basic React application that consists of a navbar component and a main content component. The navbar provides a navigation menu, and the main content displays a heading indicating that I am learning React.
- Features:
	- Navbar: The navbar component displays a brand name, navigation links, and a search input field with a search button.
	- Responsive Design: The navbar collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens to improve the mobile user experience.
	- Main Content: The main content component renders a heading that states "I am learning React!"
	- Component Structure: The application demonstrates the composition of multiple components (Navbar and MainContent) to create a complete page layout.
- Technologies Used: ReactJS.
