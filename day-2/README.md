### Day 2: [Profile Page]

- Description: I just learnt how to use the React JSX to build web components, I also learnt the ReactDOM render function. The function takes two argument, the page(JSX page) and the destination. I implemented what I learnt by creating a profile page using React, showcasing basic profile information, including a profile picture, name, job title, and a short bio.
- Features:
	- Profile Layout: The profile page has a structured layout with sections for the profile picture, name, job title, and bio.
	- Profile Picture: An image of the profile picture is displayed.
	- Name and Job Title: The name and job title of the profile owner are displayed.
	- Bio: A short bio is provided to give a brief description of the profile owner.
- Technologies Used: ReactJS.
